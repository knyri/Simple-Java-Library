/** The Limpel, Ziv, Welch (LZW) algorithm compresses any sequence of byte data.
 * The resulting compressed codes are larger than bytes,
 * but can each represent a group of bytes,
 * at least some of the time,
 * for what is usually an overall saving.
 * <P>
 * LZW compression recognizes sequences that have already appeared in the data,
 * and replaces each later appearance by a unique code.
 * The degree of compression depends on how much repetition is found in the data.
 * LZW compression is effective with data having many and / or lengthy
 * <B>repeat sequences,</B>
 * such as text,
 * and graphics with areas of solid color or patterns.
 * <P>
 * The sequence history should allow for the expected amount of repetition,
 * without wasting too much space in each code on a history index.
 * This version is fixed at 12 bit codes,
 * which can refer to nearly a 2^^12 item sequence history,
 * less some internal overhead.
 * This size is considered good for short message blocks,
 * and is simple to implement.
 * <P>
 * <B>Note!</B>
 * Other versions of LZW may use other sizes of sequence history,
 * and other coding conventions.
 * They are not inter-operable with this algorithm.
